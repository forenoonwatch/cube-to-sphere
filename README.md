# Cube to Sphere

## Description
A simple command line tool to convert from a 6-image cube map to a single image HDR equirectangular projection (sphere map). Primarily created to generate the basis for IBL (image based lighting) specular and diffuse environment maps based off of existing non-HDR skyboxes.

## Very Long Term Future Plans
* Graphical Interface
* Sphere to Cube as well as Cube to Sphere conversions
* Built in IBL post processing

## Dependencies
* GLFW
* GLew
* GLM
* STB Image
* STB Image Write
